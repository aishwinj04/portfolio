## Projects

Here are some of my coding projects:

1. ### **Login Form Authentication**  
   A simple login form with authentication features, including user registration and login validation.  
   - **Language:** PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript  
   - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aishwinj04/Authentication-Page)  

   **Login Form Interface:**  
   ![Login Process](assets/images/login.png)
   This is the first page users encounter, featuring the main login form and a welcoming message. It allows users to log in if they already have an account or switch to
   the sign-up form to create a new account.

   **Registration Form Interface:**  
   ![Registration Error Handling](assets/images/signup.png)
   The registration form enables new users to create an account. It validates all input before submitting it to the database, ensuring that usernames and emails are not    already in use. Passwords are encrypted using the MD5 hashing algorithm.

   **Success Page:**  
   ![Success Page](assets/images/page2.png)  
   The page users are met with once successfully logging in. 

   **Database Structure:**  
   ![Database](assets/images/database.png)  
   SQL database structure for the users table; each user has their own ID.

3. ### **[Hangman](https://aishwinj04.github.io/Hangman/)**  
   A classic game of Hangman that features words from programming and computer science principles. Each incorrect letter guessed by the player results in a custom SVG stickman adding a body part.  
   ![Hangman](assets/images/hangman.png)  
   - **Language:** HTML, CSS, Javascript  
   - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aishwinj04/Hangman)
